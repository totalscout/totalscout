- Hello there, I’m **@totalscout**
  I'm a finnish highschool student that just likes to do stuff with computers sometimes.
  This mostly involves breaking my home network in numbers of different ways.
  My skills are mostly around docker and other self hosting systems and only thing that I ask for you people is: **Please Don't DDOS Me**
